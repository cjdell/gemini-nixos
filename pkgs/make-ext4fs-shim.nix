# mke2fs shim for mobile-nixos's android `make_ext4fs` CLI (R13, 2026-09-07).
#
# WHY: mobile-nixos builds every ext4 rootfs/system image with the
# Android make_ext4fs tool (overlay/make_ext4fs; the image-builder's
# ext4.nix copyPhase). The resulting geometry cannot be grown by the
# kernel beyond exactly 2x the image size: ext4_resize_fs fails -EINVAL
# at the 2x mark (819200 blocks / 25 groups on the 1.5 GiB Gemini
# image — the fs stops there and systemd-growfs-root dies, leaving "/"
# at ~3.1 GiB). Verified on glass (kernel #329, borrowed) AND reproduced
# on the host kernel with the real image: the failure is in
# reserve_backup_gdb()/verify_reserved_gdb() (fs/ext4/resize.c) when the
# fs must add a new sparse_super backup group with reserved-GDT blocks
# the resize inode was never given — geometry-intrinsic, not a kernel
# regression.
#
# Every mke2fs geometry tested (plain defaults, -E resize=, meta_bg)
# grows 1.5G -> 27G online without issue, so this shim re-implements the
# make_ext4fs CLI on top of mke2fs with default ext4 features
# (flex_bg/64bit/metadata_csum). Hooked in via config/gemini.nix
# nixpkgs.overlays: the image-builder resolves make_ext4fs from
# pkgs.buildPackages, which carries the same overlays, so the swap is
# global for this configuration.
#
# CLI contract replicated (the only invocations the image-builder makes):
#   make_ext4fs [-b block_size] -l fs_size_bytes [-U uuid] [-L label] IMG DIR
# mke2fs -d DIR IMG NBLOCKS is the direct equivalent (make_ext4fs packs
# DIR as the fs root). Blocks = floor(bytes / block_size), matching
# make_ext4fs's exact-fit output (image block counts have always been
# byte-aligned multiples of 4096). The builder runs this under faketime
# (1970) for reproducible mtimes and follows with an e2fsprogs fsck
# checkPhase against the result.
#
# [2026-09-10] ROOT OWNERSHIP FIX. `mke2fs -d` copies the uid/gid of the
# source tree verbatim, and inside a Nix build sandbox the tree is owned
# by the unprivileged build user (uid 1000 on the aarch64 builder). The
# resulting image therefore had EVERY store file owned by 1000:100, which
# NetworkManager ("file has invalid owner (should be root)" -> it skips
# libnm-device-plugin-wifi.so, so a freshly-imaged system has NO WiFi)
# and logrotate both reject. Received on glass 2026-09-10 after a clean
# install; fixed by running mke2fs inside `fakeroot` after a fake
# `chown -R 0:0` of the tree (nixpkgs' make-ext4-fs does the same). The
# outer `faketime` LD_PRELOAD survives (fakeroot appends), so image mtimes
# stay deterministic; only the inode uid/gid change. Verified: debugfs
# shows User: 0 Group: 0 (was 1000/100) and a re-run keeps the fake mtime.
