# gemshell — the native Gemini PDA Wayland compositor + desktop shell.
#
# ONE binary: `gemshell` — the compositor (wayland-server: xdg-shell v1,
# wl_shm, seat keyboard+touch; EGL/GBM through Mesa kmsro->panfrost;
# evdev input; compositor-drawn shell chrome: status bar, launcher,
# workspaces, gestures).
#
# 2026-09-12: the old `gemsettings` wl_shm client (hand-drawn CPU UI) was
# REMOVED. The settings panel is now an in-process **egui** overlay
# (GPU-tessellated meshes, real font shaping — src/shell.rs), fed by the
# shared `gemdata::DataProvider`. The workspace also builds the data
# crates (gemdata / gemdata-device / gemdata-dummy) and the gemcli CLI
# frontend (pkgs/gemcli.nix).
#
# Story + on-glass checklist: docs/gemshell.md.
#
# Display path (same as GNOME's, single-process): gbm device on card0 ->
# eglGetPlatformDisplayEXT(EGL_PLATFORM_GBM_MESA) -> GLES3 context ->
# eglSwapBuffers page-flips through geminipda-drm's shadow plane; the
# gbm device fd's flip event paces frames. GL symbols resolve at RUNTIME
# through the /run/opengl-driver libglvnd ICD -> mesa-geminipda (kmsro
# pairs card0 with renderD128/panfrost) — exactly the GNOME path
# (docs/gnome-feasibility.md); nothing GL is baked in here.
#
# Link-time needs (all in the system closure already via the GNOME
# stack): libwayland (server+client), libxkbcommon (the xkbcommon crate
# hard-links #[link(name = "xkbcommon")]), libpng (the `png` crate),
# libgbm + libEGL (the hand-rolled EGL/gbm FFI in src/compositor/
# {gbm,render}.rs; libglvnd provides libEGL, the mesa fork provides
# libgbm).
#
# Build = native aarch64 (this flake's canonical model): rustPlatform
# from eval.pkgs; cargoLock.lockFile pins the crate set (regenerate with
# `cargo generate-lockfile` inside pkgs/gemshell and commit). egui is
# pure Rust (bundled fonts), so no extra native build inputs.
#
# Host-side iteration: `bash bin/gemshell-host-check.sh` (cargo check on
# x86_64 in a nix shell; seconds — the fast loop for this crate).
#
# Rpath: the gemdemo receipt (2026-09-08) — stdenv's generic rpath fixup
# only pulled the -dev outputs of wayland, so dlopen("libwayland-*.so.0")
# failed on glass. Pin the REAL lib dirs on the RUNPATH in postFixup
# (the ELF references pull them into the runtime closure automatically).

      A custom, minimal, single-process desktop for the Gemini PDA: a
      Wayland compositor (xdg-shell, wl_shm, keyboard + multitouch) that
      renders through EGL/GBM on the geminipda-drm KMS card (panfrost via
      Mesa kmsro), draws its own shell chrome, and hosts an in-process
      egui settings panel backed by the gemdata::DataProvider abstraction.
