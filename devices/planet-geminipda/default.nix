  # `yes`). The verified bring-up config ships those as =m, and no
  # firewall runs on this device (trusted g_ether link), so relax them to
  # the plain `module` meaning (=y or =m, warning only).
  #
  # Two merge subtleties:
  # - mkAfter: the default list comes from a later-evaluated module's
  #   plain assignment, so append after it to keep our entries in the list.
  # - lib.mkForce: the structured config is combined with lib.mkMerge,
  #   which conflicts on same-key leaf values of equal priority; forcing
  #   our items makes them win wholesale over the default block's.

  # The android system type reads the kernel package from this option
  # (via the stage-0 specialization), and NixOS uses it as the system
  # kernel (boot.kernelPackages -> system.modulesTree ->
  # /run/booted-system/kernel-modules, where modprobe/udev look for
  # /lib/modules/$(uname -r)).
  #
  # SELF-CONTAINED kernel (2026-09-08 — the borrow is retired): built
  # from the published Linux v6.6 base + the tracked bring-up delta
  # (kernel/default.nix; source model per docs/library-deltas.md). The
  # source content equals the on-glass kernel #329 tree
  # (geminipda-bringup @ 188aade69), so this is the same kernel the
  # bring-up validated, rebuilt in-nix; uname -r is the self-consistent
  # "6.6.0" (no git in the source), and sramldo-smc is built in-tree
  # with matching vermagic. Everything boot-critical (mmc block, ext4,
  # ...) is =y in the config; GPU/wifi modules (panfrost, mtk_wcn,
  # wlan_gen3, rtw88_*) are =m, loaded in stage-2 from this kernel's

  # partition-scanning busybox initrd instead — the same design as the
  # verified bring-up image (~1.3 MiB gzip).
