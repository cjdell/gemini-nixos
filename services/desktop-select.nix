# Gemini desktop/session selector — GNOME, the gemshell compositor, or the
# framebuffer console.
#
# GNOME is an ordinary GDM Wayland session on the geminipda-drm KMS device
# (drivers/gpu/drm/tiny/geminipda-drm.c -> /dev/dri/card0, rendered through
# panfrost via Mesa kmsro); gemshell is a system service that owns the
# panel directly; console stays on the fbcon. They can be INSTALLED side
# by side — `services.gnomeDesktop.enable` registers GNOME with the
# display manager (`services.displayManager.sessionPackages`) — and only
# ONE can own the panel at a time, which is what the marker below decides
# per boot, not the build.
#
# This module makes the choice runtime-mutable, which the plain NixOS
# options are not:
#
#   /var/lib/gemini/desktop   one of gnome|gemshell|console (persistent)
#         |
#         v
#   gemini-desktop-apply.service   (Before=display-manager.service)
#         | gnome:  SetSession/SetSessionType in AccountsService
#         | gemshell|console: create /run/gemini-console
#         v
#   display-manager.service (GDM)  has
#         ConditionPathExists=!/run/gemini-console -> skipped on console/
#         gemshell; auto-logs the user into the AccountsService session
#         otherwise
#
# `gemcli session set gnome|gemshell|console` writes the marker (and can
# apply it now / reboot). The compile-time `services.geminiDesktop.mode`
# is only the fallback used when the marker is absent (fresh install).
#
# Why AccountsService and not `services.displayManager.defaultSession`:
# that option is emitted as a GDM preStart call to set-session, i.e. it
# OVERWRITES the session on every display-manager start. services/
# gnome.nix therefore leaves it unset (defaultSession = null) so the
# marker is authoritative; this module reproduces set-session's two
# setters directly (busctl, no python).
#
# Full story, receipts and the on-glass checklist:
# docs/desktop-selection.md.
