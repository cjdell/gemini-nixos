# cl2-down.sh — power DOWN the A72 cluster (cpu8/cpu9) on the gemini 6.6
# kernel, returning the box to its cold-boot power state: cluster off,
# B_EXT_BUCK_ISO re-asserted (0x10006290 bit1), MP2_CPUSYS_PWR_CON bit0
# clear (0x10006218), external DA9214 BUCKB rail off. Run ON THE DEVICE.
#
# The reverse of cl2-up.sh (same dir). cl2-up.sh brings the COLD cluster up
# with a Linux-side pre-sequence; cl2-down.sh is the power-saving path.
#
# What actually happens on offline (receipts: session-log 2026-09-07 A72-down
# session; vendor 3.18 arch/arm64/kernel/psci.c cpu_power_off_buck; secure-
# firmware attribution in the sibling mainline project's
# 2026-08-05-a72-secure-cpu-off-attribution effect-inventory.tsv):
#   - Per-core CPU_OFF (cpu9 while cpu8 is up) is SAFE: the secure world
#     waits for the core's WFI, clears only its per-core power-control words
#     and its big_on ledger bit; the cluster branch is not entered. Proven
#     live 2026-09-07 ("psci: CPU9 killed (polled 0 ms)").
#   - The LAST A72's teardown is NOT symmetric with the up path: it runs
#     inside the controlling CPU's AFFINITY_INFO SMC (the secure world's
#     power_off_big/power_off_cl3): CCI snoop withdrawal, B mux/PLL control,
#     SPM MP2 cluster power-down, then RMW-SET B_EXT_BUCK_ISO and clear of
#     0x10006218 bit0. It has EIGHT+ UNBOUNDED wait sites: a stall = cpu0
#     stuck in the secure world = whole-box freeze, so the MTK WDT (armed
#     below, 20 s) is the ONLY recovery (EXRST). Nobody had run this branch
#     on mainline before 2026-09-07; stock Android 3.18 did it routinely.
#   - The secure world does NOT drop the external DA9214 BUCKB rail (no
#     direct i2c access); that is Linux's post-teardown job (vendor
#     cpu_power_off_buck = i2cset 0x5E bit0 = 0). Do it ONLY after the
#     teardown has re-asserted ISO (0x10006290 bit1).
#
# Usage: bash cl2-down.sh [cpu9|cpu8|both]
#   cpu9   per-core off only (safe; cpu8 stays up)
#   cpu8   last-A72 off — REQUIRES cpu9 already offline, else refuses
#   both   (default) cpu9 then cpu8 = FULL cluster power-down
#
# Re-enable: bash /root/cl2-up.sh   (cold-cluster up path — the state after
# a clean down is byte-identical to the cold-boot state cl2-up was built for).
